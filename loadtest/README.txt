This directory contains some very simple loadtests, written using
the "loads" framework:

    https://github.com/mozilla/loads


To run them, do the following:

  $> make build     # installs local environment with all dependencies
  $> make test      # runs a single test, to check that everything's working
  $> make bench     # runs a much longer higher-concurrency test.


It should also be possible to submit this tessuite to a loads cluster broker,
to be run in a distriuted fashion.  We're working on the details of that...

The tests use some pre-computed SRP credentials in order to avoid having to
do a bunch of computational work in the middle of the loadtest.  They're in
the file "precomputed_credentials.js", which can be re-generated by running
the script "computed_credetials.js" from within this directory.
